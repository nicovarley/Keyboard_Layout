# SITE_Keyboard_Layout
A new ISO UK keyboard layout designed for home row and bilateral bigram typing.

Aims:
Not require the use of one finger twice in a row.
Split typing effort more evenly between hands.
Retain most hotkeys.
Reduce reaching required.

None of the 50 most common bigrams are typed by the same finger. Extreme care has been taken to place every key in a position that avoids using the same finger twice and when that occurs, it will most likely occur in the form of downwards movement. Lateral movement should be lessened greatly as all punctuation has been centralised. The most common letters have been focused on the home and top rows with a preference for the home row, then a preference for the index and middle finger where possible.
